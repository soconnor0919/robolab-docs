## Purpose of this site

This page aims to document work done on the NAO6 Robot throughout my CSCI 278 Independent Study, taking place in the spring of 2023.

## Quick Start

To begin working with your NAO, set up the required software.

=== "Ubuntu 22.10"

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/soconnor0919/robolab-installer/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip && cd robolab-installer-master && bash install.sh
    ```

Run the above command in a terminal.

Alternatively, start by [setting up your development environment](getting-started/installing-software.md).
